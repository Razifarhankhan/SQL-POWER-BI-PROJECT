# Incorporating SQL and Power BI: Unveiling Sales Insights through Interactive Dashboards

In this project, I have leveraged SQL and Power BI to create a comprehensive sales overview. By utilizing raw data and addressing various business demands, I have explored key aspects such as product sales by month and year, sales by category, sales by color, individual sales, sub-category sales, sales by customer city, and sales by product name.

To accomplish this, I initially extracted relevant data using SQL and organized it into five distinct sheets. By employing LEFT JOIN, I seamlessly integrated data from different sources. After thorough data cleaning and transformation, I utilized Power BI to craft an interactive dashboard.

To enhance the dashboard's analytical value, I incorporated slicers, pie charts, maps, graphs, line charts, and donut charts. This combination of visualization elements allows for a more insightful and comprehensive understanding of the sales data.
